# 2D Gaussian variables in python
## Materials description
- Q1.py: 2D plot of a multi gaussian random variable.   
  This script generates samples of multi gaussian variables using numpy function multivariate_normal().

- Q2.py: Bayesian estimation of the mean with sigma known.  
  This other script estimates a point location, whose measures follow a multivariate gaussian distribution.   
  2 priors distributions are studied: uniform and multi gaussian. 

- multi_gaussian_bayesian_estimation.pdf   
  This pdf files contains my notes to describe some plots resulting from the 2 scripts. The assignment subjects have been hiden because it is not me that wrote them. 
## Remarks
Please, take into account there might be errors, I am a student. Feel free to contact me if you identify something wrong, or have any suggestion. 
Those scripts were written in a limited time context for a statistical assignment.
