# 2D Gaussian variables in python
## Scripts presentation
### 2D plot of a multi gaussian random variable
The script Q1.py generates samples of multi gaussian variables using numpy function multivariate_normal().

### Bayesian estimation of the mean with sigma known
The script Q2.py to estimates a point location, whose measures follow a multivariate gaussian distribution. 
2 priors distributions are studied: uniform and multi gaussian. 

## Remarks
Please, take into account there might be errors, I am a student. 
Those scripts were written in a limited time context for a statistical assignment.
