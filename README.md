# 2D Gaussian variables in python
## Materials description
### Q1.py: 2D plot of a multi gaussian random variable
This script generates samples of multi gaussian variables using numpy function multivariate_normal().

### Q2.py: Bayesian estimation of the mean with sigma known
This other script estimates a point location, whose measures follow a multivariate gaussian distribution. __
2 priors distributions are studied: uniform and multi gaussian. 

### multi_gaussian_bayesian_estimation.pdf
This pdf files contains the assignment subject that led me to produce Q1 and Q2 codes, as my notes to answer them. 
## Remarks
Please, take into account there might be errors, I am a student. Feel free to contact me if you identify something wrong, or have any suggestion. 
Those scripts were written in a limited time context for a statistical assignment.
